The following protocol will be followed to help keep users in line with the proper updates and keep them on a single branch.
- Users who install Truesight from Google Play will only receive Ota updates and notifications from Google Play. These builds are properly signed and considered stable without any experimental features.
- Users will notice 2 different builds available on Github (if available for release). Signed releases and debugged releases. Signed releases are considered stable but offering newer features than the Google play release that we aren't ready to launch yet and still validating if the build is ready for launch and still testing newer long term features. This usually is in relationship with the built-in database and acknowledgement of whether or not data is properly being stored and being read correctly. We also need to validate if backup and restore is still functional and if the database requires any upgrades on launch. Debugged builds are unsigned and may or may not work as intended. They are designed for users to help identify problems and replicate issues for research purposes using adb, terminal and other tools to dump logcats. They may also contain experimental features. These builds will disable the Google play Ota update notifier and use its own notifier to inform the user of newer releases available to install from github. You may need to manually install these updates and allow your device to install 3rd party sources.
